# Graph2Region
Official implementation of "Graph2Region: Efficient Graph Similarity Learning with Structure and Scale Restoration"

## Running the Code

To run G2R on a specific dataset, predicting GED (Graph Edit Distance) or MCS (Maximum Commone Subgraph) similarities, use the following command:

```
python -m run --dataset_name <dataset_name> --task <ged or mcs> 
```
